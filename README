This is my second game.
TicTacToe
The game is implemented in python2.
The file twoplayer.py is Human vs Human.
The file vscomp.py is comp vs human game.
The computer never loses.
I still haven't implemented a function to check a draw.(That will be done soon.)
There is no GUI.(That will also be implemented real soon.)
For now the user will have to enter the position of the block he wants to put his variable into. The boxes are numbered as shown...

		0 | 1 | 2
		----------
		3 | 4 | 5
		----------
		6 | 7 | 8

Also by default, the first player is X and the second one is O.
With Computer, the user plays first ( user is X ).

I know, this not a perfect game. I am still working on it.
